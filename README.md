Reflection coefficients of single layer, multi-layer and shifted multi-layer ADLs

Different configurations of artificial dilectric layers are given.
The effective impedance of these layers is found using infinite and semi-infinite cascade methods.
The impedances are then utilized to evaluate the reflection coefficient.
Details of the problem statement and required matlab routines mentioned in Matlab lab 4 file.
